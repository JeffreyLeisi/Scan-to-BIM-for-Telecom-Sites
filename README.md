# Automating Scan-to-BIM for Telecom Site Planning

## Introduction

This project investigates the automation of Scan-to-BIM processes for telecom site planning. Traditionally, BIM models are created manually, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. This project evaluates existing algorithms for processing point cloud data and implements a promising approach to automate BIM model generation. The research consists of a comparative analysis of different algorithms and a case study where the selected method is applied in a real-world telecom site scenario.
