\chapter{Results}
\label{sec:results}

% This chapter presents the key findings of the research.
% It should be clear, well-structured, and supported by data, figures, and tables.

\section{Introduction}
TODO: Provide a brief introduction to the results chapter.
% - Summarize what will be presented in this chapter.
% - Explain how the results are structured (e.g., categorized by experiment, method, or research question).
% - Emphasize that this chapter presents findings objectively without interpretation (interpretation comes in the Discussion chapter).

\section{Overview of Experiments and Data Collection}
TODO: Summarize how data was collected and processed.
% - Briefly explain the key steps in data acquisition and processing.
% - Refer to the methodology chapter for details, but provide a quick overview.
% - Mention any important preprocessing or filtering applied to the data.

\section{Quantitative Results}
TODO: Present numerical results obtained from experiments or simulations.
% - Use tables, charts, and figures where necessary.
% - Report key metrics such as:
%   - Accuracy of the automated BIM model vs. manual modeling.
%   - Processing time improvements.
%   - Success rate of different algorithms.
% - Clearly label and caption all figures and tables.

\section{Qualitative Results}
TODO: Describe observations that are not purely numerical.
% - How do the models visually compare?
% - Are there noticeable artifacts or errors in the automated process?
% - Include visualizations of point clouds, meshes, and BIM models.

\section{Comparison with Manual Workflow}
TODO: Compare the automated approach with the traditional manual approach.
% - What are the strengths and weaknesses of both?
% - Where does automation outperform manual modeling, and where does it struggle?
% - Provide real-world examples from the test cases.

\section{Case Study (if applicable)}
TODO: Present case study results (if a real-world test site was used).
% - Describe the specific telecom site used in the study.
% - Show how the methodology was applied to real-world conditions.
% - Discuss any unexpected findings.

\section{Summary of Key Findings}
TODO: Summarize the main results.
% - What are the most important takeaways from the results?
% - Highlight the biggest improvements achieved.
% - Prepare a smooth transition into the discussion chapter.

% General Advice:
% - Be objective—report findings without interpretation (interpretation belongs in Discussion).
% - Use well-organized figures and tables to enhance clarity.
% - Ensure results align with research questions defined earlier.
% - Avoid overly technical explanations—focus on presenting outcomes.
