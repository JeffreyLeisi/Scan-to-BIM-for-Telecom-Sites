This thesis was developed as part of my bachelor's degree in geospatial engineering. Since I enjoy translating scientific findings into practical applications, I sought an industry-related project for my research.

Before my studies, I worked for several years in mobile network planning, where I had the opportunity to accompany dozens of telecommunications sites from the initial site survey to the building permit application. By chance, on a cold winter day, I found my bachelor's thesis topic over a lunch meeting with my former colleague, Jean-Charles Schaeggi. He supervised me on behalf of Axians, for which I am very grateful.

Furthermore, I would like to extend my special thanks to Helena Laasch from the Institute for Geosensors and Engineering Geodesy. She was my first point of contact at ETH. Because the institute did not have much practical BIM expertise, she connected me with the Institute of Construction and Infrastructure Management, where I found my two supervisors, Oc√©ane Durand Maniclas and Kasimir Forth...
