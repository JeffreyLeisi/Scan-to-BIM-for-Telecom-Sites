\chapter{Methodology}
\label{sec:methodology}

% The methodology chapter describes the research approach, data collection, 
% processing methods, and evaluation techniques. It should be clear and reproducible.

\section{Introduction}
TODO: Provide an overview of the methodology.
% - Explain the purpose of this chapter.
% - Describe how the methodology aligns with the research objectives.
% - Briefly outline the structure of the chapter.

\section{Research Approach}
TODO: Define the overall research strategy.
% - Is the research experimental, comparative, or case-study-based?
% - Justify why this approach is suitable for addressing the research questions.
% - Mention if the research is qualitative, quantitative, or mixed-methods.

\section{Data Collection}
TODO: Describe the data sources and acquisition methods.
% - What data is used (e.g., point clouds, existing BIM models)?
% - How was the data collected (e.g., LiDAR scanning, photogrammetry, existing datasets)?
% - Discuss the accuracy, format, and preprocessing of the data.

\section{Point Cloud Processing and Preprocessing}
TODO: Explain the techniques used to process raw data.
% - How are point clouds cleaned and filtered (e.g., noise reduction, downsampling)?
% - Describe segmentation, feature extraction, and clustering methods.
% - Mention any software or tools used (e.g., CloudCompare, Open3D, Python libraries).

\section{Algorithm Selection and Implementation}
TODO: Describe the algorithms and techniques used for BIM generation.
% - Which algorithms are tested (e.g., RANSAC, PolyFit, deep learning-based methods)?
% - Justify why these specific methods were chosen.
% - Explain the implementation steps (e.g., input processing, model fitting, error handling).

\section{Evaluation Criteria and Validation}
TODO: Define how the performance of the methodology is assessed.
% - What metrics are used (e.g., accuracy, processing time, computational efficiency)?
% - Describe how the results are validated (e.g., comparison with manual models, benchmark datasets).
% - Mention any statistical or visual validation techniques.

\section{Tools and Software}
TODO: List and explain the tools used in the research.
% - Mention software (e.g., Autodesk Revit, Open3D, CloudCompare).
% - Specify programming languages, libraries, and frameworks.
% - Describe any custom scripts or automation processes.

\section{Limitations and Challenges}
TODO: Identify potential limitations of the methodology.
% - Were there any technical constraints?
% - What assumptions were made?
% - Mention any challenges faced during implementation.

\section{Summary}
TODO: Summarize the methodology.
% - Briefly restate the key steps.
% - Explain how the methodology prepares for the results chapter.
% - Transition into the next chapter.

% General Advice:
% - Ensure clarity and reproducibility so others can replicate the study.
% - Justify all methodological choices with reasoning or references.
% - Use diagrams or flowcharts if needed to illustrate workflows.
