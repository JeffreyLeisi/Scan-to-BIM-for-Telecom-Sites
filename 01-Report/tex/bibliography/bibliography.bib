  abstract = {The 5G cellular network is no longer hype. Mobile network operators (MNO) around the world (e.g., Verizon and AT\&T in the USA) started deploying 5G networks in mid-frequency bands (i.e., 3--6 GHz) with existing 4G cellular networks. The mid-frequency band can significantly boost the existing network performance additional spectrum (i.e., 50 MHz--100 MHz). However, the high-frequency bands (i.e., 24 GHz--100 GHz) can offer a wider spectrum (i.e., 400{\textasciitilde}800 MHz), which is needed to meet the ever-growing capacity demands, highest bitrates ({\textasciitilde}20 Gb/s), and lowest latencies. As we move to the higher frequency bands, the free space propagation loss increases significantly, which will limit the individual cell site radius to 100 m for the high-frequency band compared to several kilometers in 4G. Therefore, the MNOs will need to deploy hundreds of new small cells (e.g., 100 m cell radius) compared to one large cell site (e.g., Macrocell with several km in radius) to ensure 100\% network coverage for the same area. It will be a big challenge for the MNOs to accurately plan and acquire these massive numbers of new cell site locations to provide uniform 5G coverage. This paper first describes the 5G coverage planning with a traditional three-sector cell. It then proposes an updated cell architecture with six sectors and an advanced antenna system that provides better 5G coverage. Finally, it describes the potential challenges of 5G network deployment with future research directions.},

  abstract = {Point cloud processing is an essential task in many applications in the AEC domain, such as automated progress assessment, quality control and 3D reconstruction. As much of the procedure used to process the point clouds is shared among these applications, we identify common processing steps and analyse relevant algorithms found in the literature published in the last 5 years. We start by describing current efforts on both progress and quality monitoring and their particular requirements. Then, in the context of those applications, we dive into the specific procedures related to processing point clouds acquired using laser scanners. An emphasis is given to the scan planning process, as it can greatly influence the data collection process and the quality of the data. The data collection phase is discussed, focusing on point cloud data acquired by laser scanning. Its operating mode is explained and the factors that influence its performance are detailed. Data preprocessing methodologies are presented, aiming to introduce techniques used in the literature to, among other aspects, increase the registration performance by identifying and removing redundant data. Geometry extraction techniques are described, concerning both interior and outdoor reconstruction, as well as currently used relationship representation structures. In the end, we identify certain gaps in the literature that may constitute interesting topics for future research. Based on this review, it is evident that a key limitation associated with both Scan-to-BIM and Scan-vs-BIM algorithms is handling missing data due to occlusion, which can be reduced by multi-platform sensor fusion and efficient scan planning. Another limitation is the lack of consideration for laser scanner performance characteristics when planning the scanning operation and the apparent disconnection between the planning and data collection stages. Furthermore, the lack of representative benchmark datasets is hindering proper comparison of Scan-to-BIM and Scan-vs-BIM techniques, as well as the integration of state-of-the-art deep-learning methods that can give a positive contribution in scene interpretation and modelling.},

The main contribution of this work is a generative neural network architecture whose input is a range scan of a 3D object and whose output is an indexed face set conditioned on the input scan. In order to generate a 3D mesh as a set of vertices and face indices, the generative model builds on a series of proxy losses for vertices, edges, and faces. At each stage, we realize a one-to-one discrete mapping between the predicted and ground truth data points with a combination of convolutional- and graph neural network architectures. This enables our algorithm to predict a compact mesh representation similar to those created through manual artist effort using 3D modeling software. Our generated mesh results thus produce sharper, cleaner meshes with a fundamentally different structure from those generated through implicit functions, a first step in bridging the gap towards artist-created CAD models.},

  abstract = {The automation of 3D geometric model reconstruction from point clouds is essential for efficient management of critical infrastructure assets like bridges, significantly streamlining and enhancing inspection and structural analysis tasks. However, existing automated frameworks frequently encounter challenges due to substantial computational demands and the difficulties when applied to defective point clouds, which arise from adverse environmental conditions, measurement errors, and limitations of surveying equipment. Major limitations also exist in achieving real-time data exchange and mapping between Building Information Modelling (BIM) models and simulation (Sim) models. To address this gap, this paper proposes a comprehensive Scan-to-BIM-to-Sim framework that efficiently reconstructs bridge BIM models from imperfect point clouds and supports bidirectional mapping between BIM and numerical simulations. The method proposes an improved edge detection for contour extraction from imperfect point cloud and parametric modelling for the direct generation of 3D models within BIM software. Additionally, it automates the exchange between BIM models and simulation software, facilitating bidirectional operation for real-time analysis and visualisation. The framework, validated using the Arial Aqueduct Bridge case, reduces modelling time and computational demands, thereby streamlining construction simulations with improved accuracy and cost efficiency. The dataset collected for model generation and validation is openly available at https://doi.org/10.17632/znxxsgn2ky.1.},

Second, an optimization strategy using the genetic algorithm is proposed to find the optimal cell sites.

  abstract = {We propose a novel framework for reconstructing lightweight polygonal surfaces from point clouds 1. Unlike traditional methods that focus on either extracting good geometric primitives or obtaining proper arrangements of primitives, the emphasis of this work lies in intersecting the primitives (planes only) and seeking for an appropriate combination of them to obtain a manifold polygonal surface model without boundary. We show that reconstruction from point clouds can be cast as a binary labeling problem. Our method is based on a hypothesizing and selection strategy. We first generate a reasonably large set of face candidates by intersecting the extracted planar primitives. Then an optimal subset of the candidate faces is selected through optimization. Our optimization is based on a binary linear programming formulation under hard constraints that enforce the final polygonal surface model to be manifold and watertight. Experiments on point clouds from various sources demonstrate that our method can generate lightweight polygonal surface models of arbitrary piecewise planar objects. Besides, our method is capable of recovering sharp features and is robust to noise, outliers, and missing data.},

  abstract = {Scan-to-BIM is the process of converting point cloud data into a Building Information Model (BIM) that has proven essential for the AEC industry. Scan-to-BIM consists of two fundamental tasks---semantic segmentation and 3D reconstruction. Deep learning has proven useful for semantic segmentation, and its integration into the Scan-to-BIM workflow can benefit the automation of BIM reconstruction. Given the rapid advancement of deep learning algorithms in recent years, it is crucial to analyze how their accuracy impacts reconstruction quality. In this study, we compare the performance of five deep learning models---PointNeXt, PointMetaBase, PointTransformer V1, PointTransformer V3, and Swin3D---and examine their influence on wall reconstruction. We propose a novel yet simple workflow that integrates deep learning and RANSAC for reconstructing walls, a fundamental architectural element. Interestingly, our findings reveal that even when semantic segmentation accuracy is lower, reconstruction accuracy may still be high. Swin3D consistently outperformed the other models in both tasks, while PointNeXt, despite weaker segmentation, demonstrated high reconstruction accuracy. PTV3, with its faster performance, is a viable option, whereas PTV1 and PointMetaBase delivered subpar results. We provide insights into why this occurred based on the architectural differences among the deep learning models evaluated. To ensure reproducibility, our study exclusively utilizes open-source software and Python 3.11 for processing, allowing future researchers to replicate and build upon our workflow.},

BIM involves various remote-sensing tools, procedures and standards that are useful for collating the semantic information required to produce 3D models. This is thanks to LiDAR technology, which has become one of the key elements in BIM, useful to capture a semantically rich geometric representation of 3D models in terms of 3D point clouds. This review paper explains the `Scan to BIM' methodology in detail. The paper starts by summarising the 3D point clouds of LiDAR and photogrammetry. LiDAR systems based on different platforms, such as mobile, terrestrial, spaceborne and airborne, are outlined and compared. In addition, the importance of integrating multisource data is briefly discussed. Various methodologies involved in point-cloud processing such as sampling, registration and semantic segmentation are explained in detail. Furthermore, different open BIM standards are summarised and compared. Finally, current limitations and future directions are highlighted to provide useful solutions for efficient BIM models.},

Current developments in the construction industry, and new requirements emerging worldwide, have increased the demand for building information modeling (BIM) models as the end product of these surveys. Still, because BIM is a new paradigm, many professionals find the transition challenging, especially when dealing with old and heritage buildings. The new ways of the market demand solutions to optimize processes and make architectural reconstruction from point clouds even more efficient. An online questionnaire survey was carried out with 208 industry professionals working in 78 countries to assess the scope of these demands. As a result, the article presents an overview of current scan-to-BIM practices worldwide with data regarding the architectural survey and BIM modeling derived from point clouds. The implemented survey also identifies in which countries BIM adherence is most accelerated for conventional buildings and for listed buildings and non-listed old buildings, the main benefits and difficulties encountered by professionals, tools and workflows used, and the role of different professionals in collaborative work.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Building information modelling (BIM) has been adopted in the construction industry. The success of BIM implementation relies on the accurate building information stored in BIM models. However, building information in BIM models can be inaccurate, out-of-date, or missing in real-world projects. 3D laser scanning has been leveraged to capture the accurate as-is conditions of buildings and create as-is BIM models of buildings; this is known as the scan-to-BIM process. Although industry practitioners and researchers have implemented and studied the scan-to-BIM process, there is no framework that systematically defines and discusses the key steps and considerations in the process. This study proposes an application-oriented framework for scan-to-BIM, which describes the four major steps of a scan-to-BIM process and their relationships. The framework is oriented towards the specific BIM application to be implemented using the created as-is BIM, and includes four steps: (1) identification of information requirements, (2) determination of required scan data quality, (3) scan data acquisition, and (4) as-is BIM reconstruction. Two illustrative examples are provided to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed scan-to-BIM framework. Furthermore, future research directions within the scan-to-BIM framework are suggested.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

However, the inherent noise in oblique photogrammetric point cloud resulting from the image-dense matching limits further model reconstruction applications. Thus, this paper proposes a novel method for the efficient reconstruction of LoD-2 building models guided by fa{\c c}ade structures from an oblique photogrammetric point cloud. First, a building planar layout is constructed combined with footprint data and the vertical planes of the building based on spatial consistency constraints. The cells in the planar layout represent roof structures with a distinct altitude difference. Then, we introduce regularity constraints and a binary integer programming model to abstract the fa{\c c}ade with the best-fitting monotonic regularized profiles. Combined with the planar layout and regularized profiles, a 2D building topology is constructed. Finally, the vertices of building roof facets can be derived from the 2D building topology, thus generating a LoD-2 building model. Experimental results using real datasets indicate that the proposed method can generate reliable reconstruction results compared with two state-of-the-art methods.},
